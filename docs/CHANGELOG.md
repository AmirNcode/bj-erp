# CHANGELOG

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). This project will adopt semantic
versioning once the app is scaffolded. Until then, entries track documentation and design.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project documentation scaffold: `CLAUDE.md` (agent onboarding) and `docs/` —
  `PLAN.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, `PERMISSIONS.md`, `TASKS.md`, this changelog.
- Approved v1 design spec: `docs/specs/2026-06-23-hr-timeoff-design.md` (HR / Time-Off).
- Phase 0–2 implementation plan (TDD, file-level): `docs/plans/2026-06-23-hr-timeoff-v1.md`.
- Recorded key decisions: fresh build on Next.js + Supabase reusing Frappe HR's leave data model;
  admin-issued username/password auth; Farsi-default RTL + English; full Supabase with self-host
  for production; direct-manager approval with admin override; statutory leave types + balance
  ledger; full/half-day (hourly reserved); configurable Friday weekend + seeded Iranian holidays.

### Implemented — Phase 0 (Scaffold)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind; Vitest + Playwright harness.
- Farsi-default **RTL** via next-intl (fa/en); PWA manifest (installable, persistent session).
- Supabase project `bj-app` (eu-central-1); typed server/browser clients (`@supabase/ssr`, Next 16 async cookies).

### Implemented — Phase 1 (Identity & Org)
- Schema: `companies, departments, profiles, user_roles, audit_log` (+ enums); generated TS types.
- **RLS** on all tables; helper fns in a PostgREST-hidden `private` schema; security advisor: 0 accidental lints. Visibility matrix verified (employee→own team; manager/security→all; write-scoping correct).
- **Auth**: employee-code + password login (synthetic-email mapping), persistent session, route guard; next-intl + Supabase session refresh composed in `proxy.ts`.
- **Admin** employee CRUD: create (in-DB `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC — no service_role secret), update (role-aware column subset), roles/team/manager assignment, activate/deactivate, password reset; audit logged.
- **Manager**: "My Team" view + edit of direct reports (RLS-scoped, column-limited).
- Seed (interim): 1 company, 4 departments (3 teams + Security), 1 admin (`admin`).

### Next
- Phase 2 — Leave core: leave schema, working-day counting (weekend + holidays), allocations + balance ledger, request submission on the Persian/Gregorian calendar.
